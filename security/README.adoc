# Credentials

This directory contains various certificates, keystores, credential reports, and/or other sensitive configuration information related to system security that was generated as part of project construction.

This information contained in this directory should never be checked into source control. Rather, it should be stored in a secure location, such as a vault. It is then valid to leverage the information from the vault as necessary. This includes any of the following:

1. Binding the properties from the vault to k8s secrets for use by containers at runtime in your target environment.
2. Don't directly leverage the vault. Instead, supply the properties to the application by storing encrypted in a Spring Cloud Config Server repository.
3. Use the vault as a backing store for Spring Cloud Config Server.

The default Broadleaf approach is (2) when the config server supporting component is enabled in the manifest and included in the active docker items in the manifest.
